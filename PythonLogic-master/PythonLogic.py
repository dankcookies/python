# Description: Write the 4 functions described below in comments
#
#     Style - Code format, whitespace and PEP-8 style is followed making code easy to read.
#     Comments - Blocks of code are well commented, every function has a descriptive comment.
#     Tests -   The program runs as described in the specifications without errors(passes all tests).

# The number 6 is great number.
# Given two int values, a and b, return True if either one is 6.
# Or if their sum or difference is 6.
# Note: the function abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number.

# For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10
# if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately,
# round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less
# than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of
# their rounded values.
#
# To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "def round10(num):"
# and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same
# indent level as round_sum().
